# React Electron
Easy-to-understand-and-use boilerplate code for creating an Electron desktop app simply using Reactjs.
This project was bootstrapped with [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](Create React App), [https://www.electronjs.org/](Electron), and [https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder](electron-builder).

## Used following command

npm i -D electron electron-builder concurrently wait-on
npm i cross-env electron-is-dev

### Run dev server.

    `npm run start`

### Deploy to Desktop
1. Run the build process
    `npm run build`
    
2. Go into your project folder using your file explorer. Navigate to the dist folder and open it. Then double-click <your-project-name> Setup. Your app should open and there should now be an icon on your desktop for this app.
